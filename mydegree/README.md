# Description

I studied a Maths Degree at Salamanca's University (Spain) and I upload here assignments that I have been able to found among my backups.

When I was not forced to use a particular technology I used the C programming language. In those days (mid 1990's) I used mostly Turbo C 2.0 although Borland C++ 3.1 and Borland Builder were also used by me to deliver my assignments although I used vi and [xwpe](http://www.identicalsoftware.com/xwpe/) to code under Linux when no graphics were needed. The reason for that was that binaries needed to be executed in MS-DOS by my teachers but I felt more comfortable using Linux that MS-DOS/Windows I chose to use Linux to code using ANSI C and after that I compiled in MS-DOS to get the binary and deliver my assignment.

All the stuff is written in Spanish.

## Disclaimer

I have uploaded all this stuff as I found it in my backups. What that's this mean? I do not know if this stuff are the final assignment or a previous backup. So buggy source code could be present.
