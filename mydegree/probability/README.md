# Probability

It was coded using Turbo C 2.0 (from Borland) under MS-DOS and uses non ANSI C functions to draw results.

This program simulates throwing two dice and shows the probability of each possible result comparing it with the real probability.

You can throw the two dice once at a time or simulate a number of throws.

All the code comments and data structures are in Spanish.
