# B.I.A.G.R.A

B.I.A.G.R.A stands for BIbliotecA de proGRamacion científicA which means Scientific Programming Library.

This library was developed by me to perform my duties at University when I needed to program them instead of using Mathematica/Matlab/Octave ... 

Unfortunately I couldn't find a more recent version of the library so some functions are lost. Maybe I can find a more recient version in some old backup and then I will update this repo.

Some of the lost functions were related to:

* System of linear equations
* Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
* Matrix factorization
* Partial differential equations

All the code and documentation (biagra.pdf) was originally written in spanish. Now I am translating into English and adapting code.

The documentation was not finished.

At this very moment I am doing the following:

* translating into English (code and documentation)
* creating documentation, most of it was missing
* cleaning the code
* including examples of how BIAGRA can be used
* At this moment code has not been properly tested

When I originally created this code the Spanish motto was "Algún día esta biblioteca será la ...." :)
