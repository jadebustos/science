# B.I.A.G.R.A

B.I.A.G.R.A stands for BIbliotecA de proGRamacion cient√≠ficA which means Scientic Programming Library.

This library was developed by me to perform my duties at University when I needed to program them instead of using Mathematica/Matlab/Octave ...

All the code and documentation (biagra.pdf) was originally written in spanish. Now I am translating into English and adapting code.

The documentation was not finished.

At this very moment I am doing the following:

* translating into English (code and documentation)
* creating documentation, most of it was missing
* cleaning the code
* including examples of how BIAGRA can be used
